I am currently studying journalism at the School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University. My major interest lies in the fields of journalism theory and sociology of news production. Computational communication, as a quantitative method, is something I hope to utilize in the future, especially in areas such as social network analysis, discourse analysis of meta-news, and content analysis. The data thinking and methods of computational communication can provide strong support in these areas.

I have previously interned at traditional media outlets and American news-related foreign companies, mainly focusing on content production. During my graduate studies, I hope to further develop my practical journalism skills and the data analysis skills I acquire in computational communication, aiming for a better career development.
