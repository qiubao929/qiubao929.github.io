Born in Shandong Province in 2000, I studied journalism at **Northeastern University** in Shenyang, Liaoning Province from 2019 to 2023.

During the undergraduate period, I majored in communication theory, new media and society, and also took elective courses in python and the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (around the TensorFlow framework of deep learning). Master the research methods such as questionnaire survey and content analysis.

In 2023, I came to the School of Journalism and Communication at **Nanjing University**. Here, I continue to study journalism and hope to further enhance my coding and research skills by taking courses in computational communication.

In my daily life, I like photography and travelling, and have visited 8 cities in 2023, including Hong Kong, Inner Mongolia and Suzhou, etc. As an amateur photographer, I have 1800+ followers in Sina Weibo. Looking forward to communicating with teachers and students who share the same interest.
